# Fractional Factorial Design

Each model has ten independent variables. The value of each variable, ranging from -1 to 1. The dependent variable Y is given by a function of the independent variables. There is a belief that the model will involve five or fewer independent variables. We need to estimate the function of the independent variables by designing an experiment with the smallest possible amount of data. I perform a 2^{10-2} fractional factorial design and statistical analysis to estimate the function with R programming.
