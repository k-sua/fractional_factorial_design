### Introduction Section

There are ten independent variables ($A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J,K$). Each variable $x_i$ satisfies $âˆ’1\leq x_i \leq 1$ for $i=A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J,K$ given by $Y=f(a,b,...,k)+\epsilon$ that is potentially a function of up to ten variables.
The rationale of the design is the following. 

(1) Detect which factors has main effect on $Y$.
(2) Detect which factors has interaction effects with whom on $Y$.
(3) Determine $Y=f(a,b,c,...,j)$ by finding the estimated model $\hat{Y}$.  

### Method Section

We perform a $2^{10-2}$ fractional factorial design with generators $J=ABCDEF$, $K=ABCGH$ with 256 runs with resolution . In this design, based on the assumption that all 3-factor and higher interaction terms are non-existent based on the sparsity effect principle, we perform the design that has no aliasing among main effects and 2 factor interactions but, aliasing among few 3 factor interactions or higher interactions.
Our assumption of the model is that (1) it is a multiple linear regression with interaction where the error term,$\epsilon$ is (2) normally distributed with 0 mean and (3) $\sigma^2$ constant variance.Also, (4) the errors are uncorrelated. 


```{r}
library("FrF2")
library("multcomp")
library("DescTools")
dse=FrF2(nfactors=10,nruns=2^(10-2))
summary(dse)
```

The protocol for validating the estimated model will be the following. 

(1) We will evaluate and compare models to detect the significant factors and interaction terms with significance level 0.05 by using the ANOVA table, the Bonferroni confidence interval, and Half-Normal Plot. 
(2) We will check the performance of the estimated model using adjusted $R$-squared.
(3) Check the normality assumption of $Y$ using the Normal Probability Plot. 
(4) Check the constant variance assumption of $Y$ or $\epsilon$ error using the Residual Plot between the fitted values and residuals of the estimated model.

We use the the adjusted $R$-squared since it measures the variation explained by only the independent variables that actually affect the dependent variable. Thus, a multiple linear regression with interaction term has a good fit when the adjusted $R$-squared value is high. 

### Results Section

#### Sample Data Analysis
 
The result for the experiment based on the basic design of the 8 factors($A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H$) is the following data. The dataset is clearly shown in the Appendix section. Let $y$ be the response variable and $X$ be a matrix with columns of results for each factor.
```{r}
dat=read.csv("total20.csv")
sample=dat[,-1]
sample$A=as.factor(sample$A)
sample$B=as.factor(sample$B)
sample$C=as.factor(sample$C)
sample$D=as.factor(sample$D)
sample$E=as.factor(sample$E)
sample$F=as.factor(sample$F)
sample$G=as.factor(sample$G)
sample$H=as.factor(sample$H)
sample$J=as.factor(sample$J)
sample$K=as.factor(sample$K)
y=sample["y"];X=sample[,-11]
```


The table below shows the mean value for $Y$ for each factor and level of the factor. We can see that $A$ factor seems to have a big effect on the response $Y$ as the higher setting of $A$ has the maximum mean value of $Y$ while the lower setting of $A$ has the minimum mean value of $Y$.
```{r}
A=as.table(by(sample$y,list(sample$A),mean))
B=as.table(by(sample$y,list(sample$B),mean))
C=as.table(by(sample$y,list(sample$C),mean))
D=as.table(by(sample$y,list(sample$D),mean))
E=as.table(by(sample$y,list(sample$E),mean))
F=as.table(by(sample$y,list(sample$F),mean))
G=as.table(by(sample$y,list(sample$G),mean))
H=as.table(by(sample$y,list(sample$H),mean))
J=as.table(by(sample$y,list(sample$J),mean))
K=as.table(by(sample$y,list(sample$K),mean))
rbind(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J,K)
```

Below is the boxplot for each level of 10 factors for the response value of $Y$. It seems to be that $A,C,K$ has outliers of $Y$.
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,5))
boxplot(y~sample$A,data=sample,xlab="A")
boxplot(y~sample$B,data=sample,xlab="B")
boxplot(y~sample$C,data=sample,xlab="C")
boxplot(y~sample$D,data=sample,xlab="D")
boxplot(y~sample$E,data=sample,xlab="E")
boxplot(y~sample$F,data=sample,xlab="F")
boxplot(y~sample$G,data=sample,xlab="G")
boxplot(y~sample$H,data=sample,xlab="H")
boxplot(y~sample$J,data=sample,xlab="J")
boxplot(y~sample$K,data=sample,xlab="K")
```

Based on the following analysis of the values of $Y$, we can see that there are no outliers in the sample data of $Y$, which seems to have a distribution similar to normal. 
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(y,horizontal=TRUE, main="Box Plot", xlab="Y")
hist(sample$y,main="Histogram", xlab="Y");summary(sample$y)
```

#### Model Fitting

We start by assuming an model with no interaction, then a model up to 2 factor interactions, assuming that 3-factor and higher interaction terms are non-existent based on the sparsity effect principle, and lastly check whether there is significant 3 factor interaction. Now, let us fit a model with up to 3 order interactions. The aliasing structure for 3 interactions are the following. 
```{r}
aliases(lm(y ~ (.)^3, data = sample), code=TRUE)
```
Thus, the estimated effects of the three interactions above are the collaborated effects of itself and its alias. 

Let us construct a model with no interaction.
```{r}
m=aov(y~A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H+J+K,data=sample)
summary(m)
```

Based on the ANOVA table above $A$ and $D$ are the only significant factors with very small p-value. Now let us compute the Bonferroni confidence interval with significance level 0.05. The result shows the both intervals do not contain 0 thus, there is a difference in effect between both levels of factor $A$ and $D$.

```{r}
#  Posthoc multiple comparisons of means : Bonferroni 
#    95% family-wise confidence level
PostHocTest(m, method = "bonferroni")$A
PostHocTest(m, method = "bonferroni")$D
```
Now, let us construct a model up to 2 factor interactions. 
```{r}
m2= aov(y~(A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H+J+K)^2,data=sample)
summary(m2)
```
In this model, $A$ and $D$ are the significant main factors, and $BF,CE,FG,DK$ terms are significant level of 0.1. Let us construct the Bonferroni confidence interval with significance level of 0.05 of the 4 interaction terms to determine whether there is a difference on effect among different combinations of levels for each 2 factor interaction. 

```{r}
result01=PostHocTest(m2, method = "bonferroni")$`B:F`
result02=PostHocTest(m2, method = "bonferroni")$`C:E`
result03=PostHocTest(m2, method = "bonferroni")$`F:G`
result04=PostHocTest(m2, method = "bonferroni")$`D:K`
knitr::kable(result01,caption="BF Interaction")
```
 
```{r}
knitr::kable(result02,caption="CE Interaction")
```
```{r}
knitr::kable(result03,caption="FG Interaction")
```
```{r}
knitr::kable(result04,caption="DK Interaction")
```
Based on the confidence intervals, $DK$ seems to be only interaction term that shows difference of effect between $D=-1,K=1$ and $D=-1,K=-1$ and between $D=1,K=1$ and $D=-1,K=1.$

Lastly, let us construct a model up to 3 factor interaction terms. 
```{r}
m3= aov(y~(A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H+J+K)^3,data=sample)
summary(m3)
```
There are 19 3-factor interaction terms with significance level of 0.1. However, due to the sparsity effect principle, it is less likely that a 3-factor interaction is significant, especially the ones that do not contain a significant main factor or 2-factor interaction, thus $DHK,ADK,DEK$ are plausible significant factors, which are aliased to 4 factor or higher order interaction terms. Since the effect of $AHK$ is actually the additive effect of $AHK$ and $BCG$, we cannot directly conclude that $AHK$ is a significant factor with very small p-value. Moreover, any 2 factor interaction in $AHK$ are non-significant;therefore, less plausible to explain the model.  

For validation, we plot Half-Normal Plot to determine how significant factor effects and non-significant factor effects are different in the model up to 3 factor interaction.

```{r}
factors <- lm(y~(A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H+J+K)^3, data = sample)
DanielPlot(factors, half=TRUE, autolab = F, main = "Half-Normal Plot of Effects")
```
Based on the Half-Normal Plot plot, $A$,$D$,$DHK$, and $AHK$ seems to be significant. 

Lastly, let us check whether there is a significant 4 factor interaction. Based on the alias structure, $DHK$ is aliased with the significant interaction term $EFGJ$. Thus, if we consider that the effect of $EFGJ$ is due to $DHK$ term,the significant 3 factor interaction term, we can conclude that there are only non-significant 4 factor interaction terms and even higher interaction terms, supporting the sparsity of effects principle. 

```{r}
aliases(lm(y ~ (.)^4, data = sample), code=TRUE)
m4=aov(y~(A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H+J+K)^4-(A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H+J+K)^3,data=sample) 
summary(m4)
```

Based on the ANOVA table below, although $DHK$ is significant with significance level of 0.05. However, comapared to the significant level of $A$ and $D$ is seems to have a p-value. Thus, following the sparsity effect principle, we will also delete $DHK$ in the model. 
```{r}
model=aov(y~A+D+D:H:K,data=sample)
summary(model)
```

Therefore, we conclude that the estimated model will be the following with adjusted $R$-squared 0.1385939. 
```{r}
final_model=aov(y~A+D,data=sample)
summary(final_model);summary.lm(final_model)$adj.r.squared
```

#### Model Adequacy Checking

Let us check whether the assumptions are violated based on the sample data and fitted values from the estimated model below. 
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
qqnorm(sample$y)
qqline(sample$y, col = 2)
y_hat=fitted(final_model)
res=final_model$residuals
plot(y_hat, res, xlab = expression(hat(y)), ylab = "Residual",
main = "Residuals vs. Fitted Values")
abline(h=0, col = "red3")
```

Based on the analysis above, the $Y$ seems to follow normal distribution and has constant variance of $\epsilon$ as the quantiles are mostly on the red line and the distribution of points on the residual plot does not show any specific pattern and seems to be a horizontal band. Thus, we can conclude that our assumptions are not violated.  

Therefore, based on the analysis, we have concluded that the estimated model is the following. 
```{r}
summary.lm(final_model)$coefficient
```
---
$\hat Y=70707.349+4926.605x_A+3965.773x_D+\epsilon$ with $ Ïµâˆ¼N(0,Ïƒ^2), Ïƒ^2<âˆž$
---

The following is the table that specifies whether each variable does or does not affect the setting of the dependent variable; 
```{r}
Variables=c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","J","K")
Model=c("In","Out","Out","In","Out","Out","Out","Out","Out","Out")
table <- data.frame(Variables,Model);table 
```


### Conclusion and Discussion Section 

$A$ and $D$ are the significant main factors to the response $Y$. The limitation of the study is that there is no strong evidence that $AHK$ is a significant factor to response $Y$ since it is aliased to $BCG$. Also, the estimated model does not have a high adjusted $R$-squared value,implying low level of fitness to the sample data. However, to prevent the overfitting issue, rather than on focusing on increasing the value of the adjusted $R$-squared value by adding significant 3 factor interaction terms,we have constructed the model based on the significant main factors solely with significance level of 0.05, applying the sparsity effect principle.
